# Next.js 15 Unexpected Behavior with useEffect and Navigation

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior in a Next.js 15 application when navigating between pages. The `About` page utilizes `useEffect` to update its state, but the changes aren't reflected after initial rendering when navigating back to the page.

## Bug Description

The `About` page uses `useEffect` to simulate an API call that updates a state variable (`count`).  After initial load and navigation away from the About page, returning to it doesn't trigger a re-render despite a change in the `count` state.  This might be linked to how Next.js 15 handles component hydration and state management in this specific edge case.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to `/about`. The count will eventually update to 1.
5. Navigate to `/` and then back to `/about`.  The count will remain at 0, not updating to 1.

## Potential Solutions

This appears to be a subtle issue related to the interaction between Next.js's incremental hydration, and how React manages state updates outside of the typical rendering cycle.  Possible solutions might involve refactoring the state management approach or explicitly forcing a re-render.  The provided solution implements the latter.
